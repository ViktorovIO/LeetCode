## 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

### Example 1:
```markdown
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```

### Example 2:
```markdown
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```

### Example 3:
```markdown
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

### Constraints:
```markdown
0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10<sup>4</sup>
```
