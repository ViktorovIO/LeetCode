## 9. Palindrome Number

Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer.

An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

For example, 121 is a palindrome while 123 is not.

### Example 1:
```markdown
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
```

### Example 2:
```markdown
Input: x = 123
Output: false
Reads 321 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

### Example 3:
```markdown
Input: x = 0
Output: true
Explanation: 0 reads as 0 from left to right and from right to left.
```

### Example 4:
```markdown
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

### Constraints:
-2<sup>31</sup> <= x <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1
